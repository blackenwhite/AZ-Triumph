1. A string of uppercase alphabets can be encoded to a string of digits,
by replacing each alphabet with their 1-based index.
For example, "BC" can be coded to "23" and "CZ" can be encoded to"326".

Given a string of digits, encoded, find the number of decoded strings.

Eg. for "226", possible decoded strings are BZ, VF, BBF. 
So the answer is 3

2. Edit distance
3. You are given three strings X,Y and Z. You need to determine 
if string Z is an interleaving of X and Y. String Z is said to be 
interleaving X and Y if all the characters of X and Y are present in Z and the order of characters 
int the individual strings is preserved

4. You are given a string s and a pattern p.
The string s consists of only lower case letters while 
the pattern can also contain '?' and '*'.
You need to find whether the pattern ccna match the string when:
'?' - Matches any single character in s.
'*' - Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence)
